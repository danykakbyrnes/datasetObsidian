# Dataset Obsidian Vault

This is a collection of datasets that I collected throughout the years. You need to load this vault into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a writing and note taking tool that can help you with topic connections. 

Topics of the datasets included are earth and environmental data, geared towards hydrology and large scale global environmental change.
