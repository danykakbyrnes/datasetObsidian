# Dataset Obsidian Vault

This is a collection of datasets useful for environmental data science and modelling applications. Each file is a markdown file with dataset details. Topics of the datasets included are earth and environmental data, geared towards hydrology and large scale global environmental change. 

## Software
To open markdown files, you can use any markdown editor. To take advantage of the full applcation of tags and links between datasets, load the vault into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a writing and note taking tool that can help you with topic connections.
